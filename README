OF-TangibleFramework is a collection of addons to be used with OpenFrameworks to support rich interaction using tabletop and tangible interfaces via the TUIO protocol.

At the moment it includes:
* An embedded simulator.
* Distortion correction for projection.
* A general framework to create gesture recognizers directly or through composition.
* A lock-free thread-safe event queue.
* Base classes for autonomous objects, with updating, drawing and event notification, with automatic subscription.
* Some basic examples on how to use the code.
* A partial implementation of tuio 1.1 (no 3D blobs or multiple sources at the moment)

Warning:
This project is currently under heavy development. The underlying code as well as the specific interfaces of
its different parts may change in the future, leaving your project unable to compile unless you keep
the framework in its original state.
Please read future READMEs and CHANGELOGs for backwards compatibility issues.
